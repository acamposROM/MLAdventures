Karpathy provides a [~100 line python file](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086) in his post https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/ that implements a simple rnn. I found some resources (linked below) that help explain and clean up the code. This repo will contain the code to implement the min-char-rnn model.
